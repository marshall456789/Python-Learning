# These lines have errors. Fix them to be valid AND follow PEP 8:
# 1st_name = "Taylor"
# user-age = 21
# class = "Computer Science"
# My Score = 100

# YOUR FIXED CODE HERE:
first_name = "Taylor"
user_age = 21
course_name = "Computer Science"  # 'class' is a keyword
my_score = 100

print(first_name, user_age, course_name, my_score)
